Lovelace yaml

Thought I would share my Lovelace setup for the app. It’s inspired by one of the concepts from [this medium page](https://medium.muz.li/30-inspiring-examples-of-smart-home-app-617311d96303) which is a link someone else posted a few months ago either on reddit or the HA forums

I’m using the beta iOS app which is why the bottom toolbar is hidden, and the [compact-custom-header card](https://github.com/maykar/compact-custom-header) to edit the top header

The main images are picture-elements and the buttons are icons with styling to give the white circular background

Pressing the buttons opens a conditional card underneath the main room image, holding the button opens the more-info box which I have replaced using the [pop up card by Thomas Loven](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/my-lovelace-plugins/70726/238)

The TV remote page has a conditional remote depending on what the harmony activity is. I need to work on this to make it look a bit nicer. The idea for the remote and the styling (which I also used for the buttons on the main home screen) [came from here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/context-aware-harmony-remote-setup/106057)

Happy to answer any questions, and will post my uilovelace if people like when I get back to my computer
